    Bring 2 quarts of water to the boil. As the water is heating, make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes to make them easier to peel. <br>
    Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Peel off skin and cut out the stem base. <br>
    Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juice and seeds. <br>
    Preheat over to 230 degrees celcius. <br>
    Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium sized bowl. Mix in the garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. <br>
    Stir in the basil and add saly and ground black pepper, adding to tase. <br>
    Slice french baguette into inch thick slices. Bruch one side of each slice with olive oil and place olive oil side down on a baking sheet. <br>
    Place the slices into the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. <br>
    Arrange bread on a platter and use a spoon to gently top each slice with the tomato mixture. <br>

      Wash Zucchini and cut into long, relatively thin slices (max 1cm thick). Sauté in olive oil on both sides, wipe off oil with paper towels. <br>
      Chop onion into small cubes and sauté in oliveoil until translucent. Press or cut garlic and add to onions. Add tomato puree and mix.
      Add pelati tomatoes and spices. Let simmer for 10 min at low heat. Optionally add chopped up courgettes, aubergines and fresh tomatoes,
      and let simmer for a little longer. Add fresh parsley last. <br>
      Mix cream cheese and/or sour cream with milk and grated Parmesan. Add salt and pepper, and optionally some nutmeg. <br>
      In oven-proof dish, layer alternately zucchini slices, tomato sauce, creamy sauce and (optionally) lasagna sheets. Make sure to distribute liquid evenly,
      i.e. layers of sauces between zucchini and pasta. Continue until all ingredients used up. Top layer should be tomato sauce. Add slices of mozzarella. <br>
      Bake in pre-heated oven at 200°C for ca. 30 min.

    <p class="instructions">
      Place the cold coffee in a bowl, add three tablespoons of the Amaretto and put to one side. <br>
      In a separate bowl beat together the egg yolks and sugar for about three minutes until thick and pale. <br>
      Add the mascarpone and beat until well mixed. Fold in the whipped cream gently with a metal spoon. <br>
      In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold the egg whites quickly but gently into the cream mixture. Add the remaining liqueur, taking care not to loose the volume. <br>
      Dip each biscuit into the coffee liqueur mixture for about two seconds on each side and shake of the excess. <br>
      Cover the bottom of an eight individual 8cm/3in dessert glasses. Spread some of the cream mixture over the biscuits and then repeat the process again, using up the biscuits and finishing with a cream layer. <br>
      Smooth the surface and dust the top with the cocoa powder. <br>
      Refrigerate for about two hours or until firm. The longer it is left, the more the flavours will develop. <br>
