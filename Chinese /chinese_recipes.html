      Cook the medium egg noodles for 3 minutes in a pan of boiling water until al dente, or as per the package instructions. Drain, then run them under cold running water, and drain again. Drizzle with a few splashes of sesame oil, and toss through to prevent them from sticking. <br>
      Season the chicken with a splash of dark soy sauce, the five-spice powder, and chilli sauce, if using. Mix well. Coat the chicken breasts lightly with the cornstarch. <br>
      Heat a wok over a high heat, add groundnut oil, and heat until smoking. Then, add the chicken, and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until cooked through. <br>
      Add the red bell peper, and stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the bean sprouts and spring onion and stir-fry for less than 1 minute. <br>
      Add the cooked noodles, and season with light soy sauce, 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, and black pepper, to taste. Stir well and serve immediately.

        <td class="amount">1</td>
        <td>lightly beaten egg</td>
      </tr>   
    </table>
    <p class="instructions">
      Preheat oven to 165 degrees Celsius. <br>
      In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.<br>
      In a medium bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar. Add the egg and almond extract and beat until well blended. Add to the flour mixture and mix well<br>
      Note: the dough will be crumbly at this point, but don't worry - it is supposed to be like this.  <br>
      Use your fingers to form the mixture into a dough, and then form the dough into 2 rolls or logs that are 10 to 12 inches long. Wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.<br>
      Take a log and lightly score the dough at 3/4 inch intervals so that you have 15 pieces and cut the dough. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a lightly greased cookie tray, approximately 1 1/2 inches apart. Place an almond in the center of each cookie and press down lightly. Repeat with the remaining dough.<br>
      Brush each cookie lightly with beaten egg before baking. Bake for 15-18 minutes, until golden brown. Cool and store in a sealed container.
